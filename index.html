<h1>Nathan D. Clark</h1>
<p>Work in progress.<br>
I'm a physics student. I received my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy and Astrophysics from <a href="https://erau.edu/" target="_blank"> Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</a> in 2024. I am currently enrolled in a Master of Science program in Engineering Physics program at ERAU.<br><br>

I spent the first half of 2024 conducting research with Dr. Richard L. Pearson, III on the long-period disk eclipsing binary system <i>epsilon Aurigae.</i> That research fell to the wayside, but I hope to publish my findings in the future.<br>

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis with Dr. Byonghoon Seo and Dr. Xuanye Ma to build an MHD simulation corresponding to the Space and Atmospheric Instrumentation Lab's plasma chamber experiment. It will (ideally) assist Dr. Seo in his research on kink instabilities and magnetic reconnection in plasma.<br><br>

<small>Did you expect anything else? Ha, I'm not <i>that</i> quick to edit.</small>
