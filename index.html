<h1>Nathan Clark</h1>
<p>Work in progress.<br>
I'm a physics student. I received my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy and Astrophysics from <a "href=https://erau.edu/">Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</a> in 2024. I am now beginning a Master of Science program in Engineering Physics program at Embry-Riddle as well.<br><br>

I'm currently finishing up research with Dr. Richard L. Pearson, III on the long-period disk eclipsing binary system <i>epsilon Aurigae.</i><br>

I will soon be starting up research with Dr. Byonghoon Seo on his work researching kink instabilities and magnetic reconnections in plasma.<br><br>

<small>Did you expect anything else? Ha, I'm not <i>that</i> quick to edit.</small>
